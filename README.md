# My Shell Configs

This Repo is a Collection of bash configurations, shortcuts and scripts that I prefer
to use on the command line. Sets up Prompt to display useful information and adds a
few useful aliases.

If you are unfamiliar with navigating and running programs via the command line, I recommend:
- [this](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) review of basic command
line operations and commands
- [this](https://bitbucket.org/BitPusher16/dotfiles/raw/49a01d929dcaebcca68bbb1859b4ac1aea93b073/refs/git/git_examples.sh) example/explanation of how to use git, and
- [this](https://vim.rtorr.com/) review of commands for vim

## How to Use these files:
These custom commands and prompts are for personal use, see [TODO List](./TODO.md) for next things to research.

See the following directories for setup/installing custom commands and prompts for a new user/computer.

### ZSH: 
After OSX updated to default to ZSH, cleaned up my custom scripts in [ZSH README](./zsh)
    - Remind Script
    - Custom Alias Files
    - Custom Prompt or OhMyZSH Theme
    - Custom ZSH Config Script to include in `~/.zshrc`
    - Custom Scripts
        - ec2ssh
        - TODO: doctor
        - TODO: setup/init

### Bash:  
Initial (old) files that customize OSX Bash shell, see more notes [Bash README](./bash)

Still in use:
    - Custom `max` script to find larger of 2 numbers
    - Custom `gitstatus` script
    - OLD: custom profiles with aliases and custom prompt for Bash Shell
