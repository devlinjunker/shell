# My Shell Configs

This Repo is a Collection of shell configurations, commands and scripts that I prefer
to increase my development speed and help me remember things.

If you are unfamiliar with navigating and running programs via the command line, I recommend:
- [this](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) review of basic command
line operations and commands
- [this](https://bitbucket.org/BitPusher16/dotfiles/raw/49a01d929dcaebcca68bbb1859b4ac1aea93b073/refs/git/git_examples.sh) example/explanation of how to use git, and
- [this](https://vim.rtorr.com/) review of commands for vim

## Dependencies

## How to Use these files:
These custom commands and prompts are for personal use, see [TODO List](./TODO.md) for next things to research.

See the following directories for setup/installing custom commands and prompts for a new user/computer.

### ZSH: 
After OSX updated to default to ZSH, cleaned up my custom scripts, see more notes in the [ZSH README](./zsh)
- Remind Script

- Custom Prompt or OhMyZSH Theme
- Custom ZSH Config Script to include in `~/.zshrc`
- Custom ZSH Hook to check node version on change directory
- Custom Scripts
    - ec2ssh
    - WIP: doctor
    - WIP: setup/init

### Bash:  
Initial (old) files that customize OSX Bash shell, see more notes in the [Bash README](./bash)

Still in use:
- Custom `max` script to find larger of 2 numbers
