# ZSH Setup and Scripts
Notes from using ZSH instead of Bash.

Contains:
- Custom rc script that configures custom auto completes
- Alias Script broken out (for custom commands)
- Remind Script (invoke with `r?` or `?` or `remind`)
- EC2 SSH Script (that references $AWS_KEY env variable)
- ZSH Hook to change node version based on `.nvmrc` file when changing directories

TBD: 
- [..] Doctor Script (for preparing shell when navigating to projects)
- [..] init and setup scripts (for install steps below)

## FAQ

### How do I install the custom shell commands and theme for faster development?
#### Use setup script 
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlinjunker/shell/master/zsh/setup.zsh)"

#### Manual Install
1. Install:
   - Oh My ZSH
   - [Optional] iTerm?
   - [Optional] MacPorts
   - [Optional] Chrome (think about switch to FF?)
2. Clone this repo
3. Add Symbolic Link for all themes to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/`
3. Update theme name in `~/.zshrc` to `bira+gitstatus`
4. Source `zshrc.sym` from this repo in `~/.zshrc` (so it is executed on startup)

### Why use ZSH over Bash?
 - ZSH provides autocomplete for git out of the box with `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit` in `zshrc.sym`
 - SSH Autocomplete improved with commands in `zshrc.sym` also (?)

**Why use MacPorts over Homebrew?**
 - Community seems to be moving away from Homebrew and towards MacPorts
 - https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-package-managers/
 - Sets up tools in isolation from system tools
   - Any kind of MacOS update that changes library versions will never affect an app installed by MacPorts
   - requires sudo for any action that affects all users (most)
 - Sets up under /opt (need to add to $PATH)

**Why use iTerm?**
 - More Colors?

**What is on the Default $PATH?**
- /Users/devlinjunker/.nvm/versions/node/v14.14.0/bin (from Macports I think)
- /usr/local/bin
- /usr/bin
- /bin
- /usr/sbin
- /sbin
- /Library/Apple/usr/bin
- /Users/devlinjunker/Code/shell/zsh/../scripts (Add Custom Scripts from `shell/scripts`)
- /opt/local/bin (Added for MacPorts?)

## Notes
- Sort of based on https://github.com/whatyouhide/dotfiles
- Started on init.sh script
  - cleaner
  - uses oh-my-zsh: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh
- Created specific zsh env files
- Split aliases and functions into separate files
  - created one that is dependent on osx (osx.zsh)
- Started on interactive prompt for remind (r!) script
  - script that reminds us of commands to use
  - renamed help file to remind with `r!` script
- ssh autocomplete
  - need to add config in `~/.ssh/config`
  - [ ] Need to investigate more
    - Can we autocomplete anything in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`?
    - How does config work? user is automatically used? but how do I reference? 
- Started on doctor.zsh script
  - add symbolic link in scripts directory to doctor.zsh so we have access in the path
- renamed init to setup.sh for once repo downloaded
- installed vscode command line exec, open with: `code <file_path>`
- `.zshenv` is executed on every new shell instance
  - linked to my `zshenv.sym` file in this directory

### Oh My ZSH
- Themes, Plugins, Framework for Configuring ZSH Shell
  - [Configuration](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Settings)
  - [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Cheatsheet)
  - [Plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins)
- Comes with Default `.zshrc` file
  - Sets theme + other configurations
  - Plus other customer lines to import my things
    - Currently:
      - Points at custom `zshrc.sym` file in this directory
  - Defines which plugins should be loaded 
    - Currently:
      - git
- set up custom theme `bira+gitstatus`
  - copied bira from `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` to `themes/` directory repo
    - This is a ruby based theme.. may want to move away from this
  - symbolic link in `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` to the directory in `themes/`
  - set theme name in `.zshrc`
  - use personal `gitstatus` script in prompt
  - shows user, host and current directory + git status if in directory

### iTerm
- Advanced Terminal (improved over osx terminal)
- Features: https://iterm2.com/features.html
  - [ ] TODO: Review these more
